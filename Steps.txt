Basic Operations
Stack operations may involve initializing the stack, using it and then de-initializing it. Apart from these basic stuffs, a stack is used for the following two primary operations −

push() − Pushing (storing) an element on the stack.

pop() − Removing (accessing) an element from the stack.

When data is PUSHed onto stack.

To use a stack efficiently, we need to check the status of stack as well. For the same purpose, the following functionality is added to stacks −

peek() − get the top data element of the stack, without removing it.

isFull() − check if stack is full.

isEmpty() − check if stack is empty.

A Pop operation may involve the following steps −

Step 1 − Checks if the stack is empty.

Step 2 − If the stack is empty, produces an error and exit.

Step 3 − If the stack is not empty, accesses the data element at which top is pointing.

Step 4 − Decreases the value of top by 1.

Step 5 − Returns success.
